## Naming
- Tables: snake_case, plural (users, order_items)
- Columns: snake_case (first_name, created_at)
- Indexes: idx_table_column (idx_users_email)
- Foreign keys: fk_table_column (fk_orders_user_id)
- Primary keys: id (or composite for junction tables)

## Structure
- Migrations: YYYY_MM_DD_HHMMSS_description.sql
- Seeds: seed_[environment]_[entity].sql
- Queries: organized by domain/feature
- Schema docs: docs/database-schema.md with ERD

## Patterns
- Use SERIAL/AUTOINCREMENT for primary keys unless UUID required
- Timestamps: created_at, updated_at (NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
- Soft deletes: deleted_at (nullable timestamp)
- Foreign keys with ON DELETE/UPDATE actions
- Check constraints for business rules
- Use transactions for multi-table operations

## Quality Standards
- Every table has a primary key
- Foreign keys have indexes
- Nullable columns are intentional (default NOT NULL)
- Enums stored as TEXT with CHECK constraints or separate tables
- Avoid BLOB for large files (store references instead)
- Add comments to complex schema elements
