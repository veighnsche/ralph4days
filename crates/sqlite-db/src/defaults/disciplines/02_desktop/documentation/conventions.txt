## Naming
- READMEs: README.md (root), README.md (packages)
- Guides: docs/guides/[topic].md
- API docs: docs/api/[resource].md
- Architecture: docs/architecture.md

## Structure
- README: Project name, description, features, installation, usage, license
- API docs: Endpoint, method, parameters, request/response examples, errors
- Guides: Goal, prerequisites, steps, troubleshooting, next steps

## Patterns
- Code examples are syntax-highlighted and runnable
- Use relative links for internal docs
- Include prerequisites at the top
- Provide copy-paste commands (not just descriptions)
- Use consistent terminology throughout

## Quality Standards
- All code examples tested and working
- No dead links (use link checkers)
- Consistent formatting (headings, code blocks)
- Clear section hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- No jargon without explanation
