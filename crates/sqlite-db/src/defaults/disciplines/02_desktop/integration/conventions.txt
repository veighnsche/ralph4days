## Naming
- Clients: [Service]Client (StripeClient, SlackClient)
- Webhooks: [service]-webhook.ts (stripe-webhook.ts)

## Patterns
- Retry failed requests (3-5 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Timeout all external requests (5-30 seconds)
- Verify webhook signatures before processing
- Use idempotency keys for critical operations
- Queue webhook processing (don't block the webhook handler)

## Quality Standards
- All API credentials in environment variables
- Webhook endpoints validate signatures
- Integration failures logged with context
- Circuit breakers for unreliable services
- Rate limiting respected (never exceed quotas)
