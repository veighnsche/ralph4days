positive:
Full body standing shot from head to feet, single person centered in frame, character fills the frame, body takes up 75 percent of the image height, eyes at 15 percent from top of frame, feet at 90 percent from top of frame, minimal headroom above head, tight framing on the body, zoomed in close to the character, camera at eye level straight on, eye height perspective, key light from upper left at 45 degrees, shadow falling to the lower right, standing upright on visible flat ground plane, feet planted on floor, arms close to body within shoulder width, dark moody background, narrow compact pose. Watercolor portrait illustration, loose expressive brushstrokes, wet on wet technique, visible paper texture, bleeding watercolor edges, ink wash details, watercolor paint dripping downward, colors bleeding outside the lines, semi-realistic human proportions, strong character silhouette, serious determined expression, 1980s blue-collar aesthetic, the medium is delicate but the subject is powerful, the entire painting dominated by the discipline color, background washes in the discipline color, discipline color everywhere. Entirely teal monochromatic image, everything is teal, teal walls, teal floor, teal ceiling, teal fixtures, teal lighting casting teal shadows, teal color grading, the entire scene bathed in teal light, monochromatic teal watercolor painting, lean young man with confident posture and focused determined eyes, short dirty blond hair, teal work shirt with rolled sleeves, teal tool belt with teal screwdrivers and teal wire strippers, hands resting on teal tool belt ready to work, teal dog tags around neck, facing the viewer head up eyes forward, workshop completely teal-tinted with teal wiring and a glowing teal CRT monitor on a teal workbench, teal dominant color, uniform teal throughout.
