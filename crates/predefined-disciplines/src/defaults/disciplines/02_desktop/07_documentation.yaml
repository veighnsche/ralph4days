  Technical documentation for desktop apps. Owns specs, info dumps,
  CLAUDE.md maintenance, and inline documentation standards.

conventions: |
  - Specs live in .specs/ with format from 000_SPECIFICATION_FORMAT.md
  - Info dumps in .docs/ numbered chronologically (NNN_DESCRIPTION.md)
  - CLAUDE.md is the canonical project context file
  - Comments explain WHY, never WHAT or HOW
  - No commented-out code (use git history)
  - No doc comments that just mirror the function name

skills:
  - technical-writing
  - specification-design
  - markdown
  - api-documentation
  - architecture-docs
