    Japanese male, late 40s, neat black hair with silver temples and thin wire-rimmed violet glasses, compact precise build, wearing a crisp violet dress shirt with a purple striped tie loosened at the collar and sleeves rolled up, one hand resting on a tall stack of purple file folders, standing with squared shoulders in front of rows of violet filing cabinets stuffed with purple paper printouts, inside a cramped 80s university data lab with a purple-screened terminal displaying scrolling violet text, purple dot-matrix printer churning paper onto the floor, violet coffee-stained mugs everywhere, violet watercolor wash bleeding through, purple paint dripping downward.
