image_prompt:
  positive: |
    Entirely amethyst purple monochromatic image, purple color wash over everything, violet tinted lighting, Elvish female, early 40s, with short silver hair swept back, petite precise build, sharp perceptive features, wearing a fitted amethyst purple robe with luminous purple crystal-lattice embroidery along the bodice and sleeves, amethyst pendant hanging from a thin chain, one hand holding up a faceted amethyst crystalline prism to the light, facing the viewer head up eyes forward, purple background, inside a purple-tinted elvish chamber of truth with faceted amethyst crystal walls that refract purple light into prismatic patterns and polished purple stone truth-mirrors lining the curved walls.

  negative: |
    blind, eyes covered, looking away from the prism, cracked cloudy lens, ignoring flaws, missing the obvious
