    Redguard human male, late 30s, strong square jaw, thick hair in short tight locs with forest green leaf-shaped ornaments woven between them, tall broad powerful muscular build, high cheekbones and a closely trimmed beard and a green jade stud in one ear, round human ears, wearing a sturdy forest green cloak with luminous green vine-pattern embroidery over desert-worn leather armor with copper rivets and green silk sash at the waist, green jade brooch at the shoulder, a curved scimitar with a jade-inlaid pommel sheathed at his hip, standing between two ornate living-wood archways with one hand resting on each connecting them, roots and green vines growing where his hands touch the wood, dramatic forest green rim lighting, warm green ambient glow, inside a towering elvish bridge chamber bathed in green light with two massive living-wood gateway arches merging into one canopy of green luminous leaves overhead behind him, honored guest among elves.
