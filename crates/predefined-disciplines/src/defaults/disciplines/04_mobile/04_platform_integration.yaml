  positive: |
    Entirely forest green monochromatic image, green color wash over everything, green tinted lighting, Redguard human male, late 30s, strong square jaw, thick hair in short tight locs with forest green leaf-shaped ornaments woven between them, tall broad powerful muscular build, high cheekbones and a closely trimmed beard and a green jade stud in one ear, round human ears, wearing a sturdy forest green cloak with luminous green vine-pattern embroidery over green leather armor with green rivets and green silk sash at the waist, green jade brooch at the shoulder, a curved scimitar with a jade-inlaid pommel sheathed at his hip, facing the viewer head up eyes forward, green background, inside a green-tinted towering elvish bridge chamber with massive living-wood gateway arches and a canopy of green luminous leaves overhead.

  negative: |
    pointed ears, elvish ears, broken bridge, collapsed archway, disconnected paths, walls between the gates, unable to reach, unwelcome, outsider rejected
