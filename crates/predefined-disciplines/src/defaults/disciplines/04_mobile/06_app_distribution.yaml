  positive: |
    Entirely gold monochromatic image, gold color wash over everything, golden tinted lighting, Elvish male, early 50s, with long golden hair streaked with white tied back in a half-knot, tall regal build, noble weathered features with a trimmed golden beard, wearing an ornate warm gold ceremonial tunic with luminous golden sun-ray embroidery radiating from the chest and golden arm bands, gold signet ring on one hand, both hands cupped open releasing a cluster of luminous golden messenger moths that spiral upward, facing the viewer head up eyes forward, gold background, inside a gold-tinted grand elvish herald tower with enormous golden-framed dispatch windows and golden horn instruments mounted on the golden walls.

  negative: |
    empty hands releasing nothing, moths dead on the ground, closed windows, sealed doors, messages undelivered, hoarding
