positive:
Full body standing shot from head to feet, single person centered in frame, character fills the frame, body takes up 75 percent of the image height, eyes at 15 percent from top of frame, feet at 90 percent from top of frame, minimal headroom above head, tight framing on the body, zoomed in close to the character. Ballpoint pen illustration entirely in the discipline accent color, colored ballpoint pen on white paper, monochrome drawing using only shades of the discipline accent color, dense ballpoint hatching and scribble shading, visible ink strokes and crosshatching, ballpoint pen pressure variation from light to heavy, the entire drawing is in the discipline color from light to dark, slightly waxy ballpoint ink texture, white paper background. Elvish female, early 30s, long silver-white hair with delicate moonsilver threads woven through, tall willowy build, standing upright facing the viewer, looking directly at the viewer, front-facing three-quarter pose, wearing a flowing moonsilver robe with luminous silver embroidery depicting interlocking patterns along every edge, silver circlet on her brow, holding a bundle of glowing silver threads in both hands in front of her chest, dramatic moonsilver rim lighting, soft silver ambient glow, inside a luminous open-air elvish weaving pavilion bathed in silver starlight with cascading silver silk tapestries and moonlit lattice archways of white flowering vines behind her.
