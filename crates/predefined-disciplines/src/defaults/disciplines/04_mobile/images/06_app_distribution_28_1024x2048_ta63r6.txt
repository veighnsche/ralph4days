positive:
Full body standing shot from head to feet, single person centered in frame, character fills the frame, body takes up 75 percent of the image height, eyes at 15 percent from top of frame, feet at 90 percent from top of frame, minimal headroom above head, tight framing on the body, zoomed in close to the character. Ballpoint pen illustration entirely in the discipline accent color, colored ballpoint pen on white paper, monochrome drawing using only shades of the discipline accent color, dense ballpoint hatching and scribble shading, visible ink strokes and crosshatching, ballpoint pen pressure variation from light to heavy, the entire drawing is in the discipline color from light to dark, slightly waxy ballpoint ink texture, white paper background. Elvish male, early 50s, long golden hair streaked with white tied back in a half-knot, tall regal build, noble weathered features with a trimmed golden beard, wearing an ornate warm gold ceremonial tunic with luminous golden sun-ray embroidery radiating from the chest and golden arm bands, gold signet ring on one hand, both hands cupped open releasing a cluster of luminous golden messenger moths that spiral upward into the air carrying light, dramatic warm gold rim lighting, rich golden ambient glow, inside a grand elvish herald tower bathed in golden light with enormous golden-framed dispatch windows open to a vast starlit sky and golden horn instruments mounted on the walls behind him.
