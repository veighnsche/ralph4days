positive:
Full body standing shot from head to feet, single person centered in frame, character fills the frame, body takes up 75 percent of the image height, eyes at 15 percent from top of frame, feet at 90 percent from top of frame, minimal headroom above head, tight framing on the body, zoomed in close to the character. Ballpoint pen illustration entirely in the discipline accent color, colored ballpoint pen on white paper, monochrome drawing using only shades of the discipline accent color, dense ballpoint hatching and scribble shading, visible ink strokes and crosshatching, ballpoint pen pressure variation from light to heavy, the entire drawing is in the discipline color from light to dark, slightly waxy ballpoint ink texture, white paper background. Elvish female, early 40s, short silver hair swept back, petite precise build, sharp perceptive features, wearing a fitted amethyst purple robe with luminous purple crystal-lattice embroidery along the bodice and sleeves, amethyst pendant hanging from a thin chain, one hand holding up a faceted amethyst crystalline prism to the light as rainbow refractions of purple light scatter through it revealing hidden truths, dramatic amethyst purple rim lighting, soft violet ambient glow, inside an elvish chamber of truth bathed in purple light with faceted amethyst crystal walls that refract purple light into prismatic patterns and polished stone truth-mirrors lining the curved walls behind her.
