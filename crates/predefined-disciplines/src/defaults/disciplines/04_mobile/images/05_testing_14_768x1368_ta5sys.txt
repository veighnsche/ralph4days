positive:
Professional polished illustration, shallow depth of field, studio lighting, clean composition. Digital illustration in art nouveau fantasy style with elegant flowing linework, luminous color palette, ornate organic details, three-quarter portrait from waist up, single person centered in frame, subject occupies lower two-thirds, high elvish fantasy aesthetic, living wood and crystal architecture, warm golden ambient light mixed with cool starlight, flowing elegant robes and armor, noble selfless bearing, strict but compassionate expression, ancient wisdom, organic curves and natural forms, pointed elvish ears, ethereal glow, inside an elvish sanctuary. Elvish female, early 40s, short silver hair swept back, petite precise build, sharp perceptive features, wearing a fitted amethyst purple robe with luminous purple crystal-lattice embroidery along the bodice and sleeves, amethyst pendant hanging from a thin chain, one hand holding up a faceted amethyst crystalline prism to the light as rainbow refractions of purple light scatter through it revealing hidden truths, dramatic amethyst purple rim lighting, soft violet ambient glow, inside an elvish chamber of truth bathed in purple light with faceted amethyst crystal walls that refract purple light into prismatic patterns and polished stone truth-mirrors lining the curved walls behind her.
