positive:
Professional polished illustration, shallow depth of field, studio lighting, clean composition. Digital illustration in art nouveau fantasy style with elegant flowing linework, luminous color palette, ornate organic details, three-quarter portrait from waist up, single person centered in frame, subject occupies lower two-thirds, high elvish fantasy aesthetic, living wood and crystal architecture, warm golden ambient light mixed with cool starlight, flowing elegant robes and armor, noble selfless bearing, strict but compassionate expression, ancient wisdom, organic curves and natural forms, pointed elvish ears, ethereal glow, inside an elvish sanctuary. Elvish female, early 30s, long silver-white hair with delicate moonsilver threads woven through, tall willowy build, wearing a flowing moonsilver robe with luminous silver embroidery depicting interlocking patterns along every edge, silver circlet on her brow, both hands moving glowing silver threads across an ornate standing loom of living white wood, weaving a tapestry of shimmering silver light, dramatic moonsilver rim lighting, soft silver ambient glow, inside a luminous open-air elvish weaving pavilion bathed in silver starlight with cascading silver silk tapestries and moonlit lattice archways of white flowering vines behind her.
