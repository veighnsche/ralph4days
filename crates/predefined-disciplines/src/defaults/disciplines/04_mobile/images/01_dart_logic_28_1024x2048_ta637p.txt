positive:
Full body standing shot from head to feet, single person centered in frame, character fills the frame, body takes up 75 percent of the image height, eyes at 15 percent from top of frame, feet at 90 percent from top of frame, minimal headroom above head, tight framing on the body, zoomed in close to the character. Ballpoint pen illustration entirely in the discipline accent color, colored ballpoint pen on white paper, monochrome drawing using only shades of the discipline accent color, dense ballpoint hatching and scribble shading, visible ink strokes and crosshatching, ballpoint pen pressure variation from light to heavy, the entire drawing is in the discipline color from light to dark, slightly waxy ballpoint ink texture, white paper background. Elvish male, mid 40s, close-cropped dark hair with deep sapphire blue streaks, lean angular build, sharp features, wearing a structured deep sapphire blue tunic with luminous blue runic patterns etched along the collar and cuffs over dark leather bracers, sapphire pendant at his throat, one hand pressing a glowing sapphire-tipped stylus into a polished crystal tablet carving precise luminous blue runes that pulse with inner light, dramatic deep sapphire rim lighting, cool blue ambient glow, inside a quiet elvish study carved from living sapphire-veined stone bathed in blue light with shelves of crystal tablets and glowing blue runic diagrams etched into the curved stone walls behind him.
