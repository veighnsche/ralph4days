positive:
Full body standing shot from head to feet, single person centered in frame, character fills the frame, body takes up 75 percent of the image height, eyes at 15 percent from top of frame, feet at 90 percent from top of frame, minimal headroom above head, tight framing on the body, zoomed in close to the character, camera at eye level straight on, eye height perspective, key light from upper left at 45 degrees, shadow falling to the lower right, standing upright on visible flat ground plane, feet planted on floor, arms close to body within shoulder width, dark moody background, narrow compact pose. Wes Anderson style photograph, perfectly symmetrical composition, a single person standing dead center in frame, their head is replaced by an object related to their discipline, human body with an object for a head, the person is comically out of place in a pastel-colored environment, discipline accent color appears as a Wes Anderson pastel tone throughout the room and clothing, obsessive symmetry, geometric framing, the person just stands there like they belong even though they absolutely do not, warm soft natural lighting, vintage film stock look, slightly desaturated, whimsical deadpan absurdist humor, meticulously art directed set design, every detail intentional, Grand Budapest Hotel aesthetic, photorealistic. Entirely blue monochromatic image, everything is blue, blue walls, blue floor, blue ceiling, blue fixtures, blue lighting casting blue shadows, blue color grading, the entire scene bathed in blue light, a stocky man with a head replaced by a blue steel hammer where a human head should be, the wooden handle extending down as his neck, wearing a blue coverall jumpsuit, standing perfectly still, the hammer head replacing his human head as the main feature, inside a pristine pastel bathroom completely blue-tinted with blue hexagonal floor tiles, blue bathtub to his left, blue pedestal sink to his right, blue wall behind him with a small blue-framed picture, blue dominant color, monochromatic blue scene.
