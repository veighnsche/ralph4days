positive:
Three-quarter portrait from waist up, single person centered in frame, subject occupies lower two-thirds, professional polished illustration, shallow depth of field, studio lighting, clean composition. Wes Anderson style photograph, perfectly symmetrical composition, a single person standing dead center in frame, their head is replaced by an object related to their discipline, human body with an object for a head, the person is comically out of place in a pastel-colored environment, discipline accent color appears as a Wes Anderson pastel tone throughout the room and clothing, obsessive symmetry, geometric framing, the person just stands there like they belong even though they absolutely do not, warm soft natural lighting, vintage film stock look, slightly desaturated, whimsical deadpan absurdist humor, meticulously art directed set design, every detail intentional, Grand Budapest Hotel aesthetic, photorealistic. A broad heavyset woman in a coral red blazer and salmon pink pants standing perfectly still dead center in a pastel coral flower shop, her head is replaced by a large red brass padlock where her head should be, padlock for a head, the shackle arching upward, the flower shop has matching coral red flower buckets on each side perfectly symmetrical filled with salmon pink roses, a red tiled floor, coral wallpaper with floral pattern, red ribbon spools on the counter behind her, warm soft lighting.
