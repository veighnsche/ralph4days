positive:
Full body standing shot from head to feet, single person centered in frame, character fills the frame, body takes up 75 percent of the image height, eyes at 15 percent from top of frame, feet at 90 percent from top of frame, minimal headroom above head, tight framing on the body, zoomed in close to the character, camera at eye level straight on, eye height perspective, key light from upper left at 45 degrees, shadow falling to the lower right, standing upright on visible flat ground plane, feet planted on floor, arms close to body within shoulder width, dark moody background, narrow compact pose. Wes Anderson style photograph, perfectly symmetrical composition, a single person standing dead center in frame, their head is replaced by an object related to their discipline, human body with an object for a head, the person is comically out of place in a pastel-colored environment, discipline accent color appears as a Wes Anderson pastel tone throughout the room and clothing, obsessive symmetry, geometric framing, the person just stands there like they belong even though they absolutely do not, warm soft natural lighting, vintage film stock look, slightly desaturated, whimsical deadpan absurdist humor, meticulously art directed set design, every detail intentional, Grand Budapest Hotel aesthetic, photorealistic. Entirely green monochromatic image, everything is green, green walls, green floor, green ceiling, green fixtures, green lighting casting green shadows, green color grading, the entire scene bathed in green light, a short stocky man with a giant green magnifying glass for a head, the round glass lens where his face should be, green handle extending down as his neck, wearing a green tweed vest and green corduroy pants, standing perfectly still dead center, the magnifying glass head as the dominant focal point, inside a hotel lobby completely green-tinted with green velvet armchairs on each side, green reception desk with green desk lamp, green wallpaper, green potted ferns in green ceramic pots, green patterned carpet, green chandelier overhead, monochromatic green scene.
