positive:
Full body standing shot from head to feet, single person centered in frame, character fills the frame, body takes up 75 percent of the image height, eyes at 15 percent from top of frame, feet at 90 percent from top of frame, minimal headroom above head, tight framing on the body, zoomed in close to the character, camera at eye level straight on, eye height perspective, key light from upper left at 45 degrees, shadow falling to the lower right, standing upright on visible flat ground plane, feet planted on floor, arms close to body within shoulder width, dark moody background, narrow compact pose. Wes Anderson style photograph, perfectly symmetrical composition, a single person standing dead center in frame, their head is replaced by an object related to their discipline, human body with an object for a head, the person is comically out of place in a pastel-colored environment, discipline accent color appears as a Wes Anderson pastel tone throughout the room and clothing, obsessive symmetry, geometric framing, the person just stands there like they belong even though they absolutely do not, warm soft natural lighting, vintage film stock look, slightly desaturated, whimsical deadpan absurdist humor, meticulously art directed set design, every detail intentional, Grand Budapest Hotel aesthetic, photorealistic. Entirely amber monochromatic image, everything is amber, amber walls, amber floor, amber ceiling, amber fixtures, golden amber lighting casting amber shadows, amber color grading, the entire scene bathed in golden amber light, a tall thin woman with a large golden brass hourglass for a head with amber sand trickling inside where her human head should be, wearing an amber turtleneck sweater and amber corduroy pants, standing perfectly still dead center, the hourglass head held upright as the focal point, inside a barbershop completely amber-tinted with amber leather barber chairs on each side, long mirror with golden amber light bulbs, amber glass bottles on golden shelves, golden scissors and combs in amber jars, amber wood paneling on amber walls, monochromatic amber scene.
