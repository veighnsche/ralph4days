positive:
Three-quarter portrait from waist up, single person centered in frame, subject occupies lower two-thirds, professional polished illustration, shallow depth of field, studio lighting, clean composition. Wes Anderson style photograph, perfectly symmetrical composition, a single person standing dead center in frame, their head is replaced by an object related to their discipline, human body with an object for a head, the person is comically out of place in a pastel-colored environment, discipline accent color appears as a Wes Anderson pastel tone throughout the room and clothing, obsessive symmetry, geometric framing, the person just stands there like they belong even though they absolutely do not, warm soft natural lighting, vintage film stock look, slightly desaturated, whimsical deadpan absurdist humor, meticulously art directed set design, every detail intentional, Grand Budapest Hotel aesthetic, photorealistic. A tall broad man in a periwinkle indigo three-piece suit with indigo pocket square standing perfectly still dead center inside a pastel periwinkle elevator, his head is replaced by a large indigo drafting compass with both legs spread open where his head should be, compass for a head, the elevator has indigo art deco paneling on each side perfectly symmetrical, a periwinkle floor indicator dial above the doors behind him, indigo blue carpet, brass indigo-tinted handrails, warm soft lighting from an indigo ceiling fixture.
