positive:
Three-quarter portrait from waist up, single person centered in frame, subject occupies lower two-thirds, professional polished illustration, shallow depth of field, studio lighting, clean composition. Wes Anderson style photograph, perfectly symmetrical composition, a single person standing dead center in frame, their head is replaced by an object related to their discipline, human body with an object for a head, the person is comically out of place in a pastel-colored environment, discipline accent color appears as a Wes Anderson pastel tone throughout the room and clothing, obsessive symmetry, geometric framing, the person just stands there like they belong even though they absolutely do not, warm soft natural lighting, vintage film stock look, slightly desaturated, whimsical deadpan absurdist humor, meticulously art directed set design, every detail intentional, Grand Budapest Hotel aesthetic, photorealistic. A stocky man in a blue coverall jumpsuit standing perfectly still dead center in a pristine pastel pink bathroom, but his head is replaced by the head of a blue steel hammer, hammer head where a human head should be, the wooden handle extends down as his neck, human body with a hammer for a head, pink hexagonal floor tiles, mint green bathtub to his left, pink pedestal sink to his right, a small framed picture perfectly centered on the wall behind him, he does not belong here but he is not leaving, blue accent color on his jumpsuit and hammer head against the pastel pink room.
