positive:
Three-quarter portrait from waist up, single person centered in frame, subject occupies lower two-thirds, professional polished illustration, shallow depth of field, studio lighting, clean composition. Wes Anderson style photograph, perfectly symmetrical composition, a single person standing dead center in frame, their head is replaced by an object related to their discipline, human body with an object for a head, the person is comically out of place in a pastel-colored environment, discipline accent color appears as a Wes Anderson pastel tone throughout the room and clothing, obsessive symmetry, geometric framing, the person just stands there like they belong even though they absolutely do not, warm soft natural lighting, vintage film stock look, slightly desaturated, whimsical deadpan absurdist humor, meticulously art directed set design, every detail intentional, Grand Budapest Hotel aesthetic, photorealistic. A tall thin woman in a lavender violet pencil skirt suit with violet buttons standing perfectly still dead center in a pastel lavender laundromat, her head is replaced by a large violet vernier caliper with jaws slightly open where her head should be, caliper for a head, the laundromat has rows of lavender washing machines on each side perfectly symmetrical, violet detergent bottles lined up on a shelf, soft lavender linoleum floor, pastel violet walls, warm soft lighting.
