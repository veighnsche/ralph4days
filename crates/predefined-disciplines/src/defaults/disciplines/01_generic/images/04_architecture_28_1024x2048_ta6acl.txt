positive:
Full body standing shot from head to feet, single person centered in frame, character fills the frame, body takes up 75 percent of the image height, eyes at 15 percent from top of frame, feet at 90 percent from top of frame, minimal headroom above head, tight framing on the body, zoomed in close to the character, camera at eye level straight on, eye height perspective, key light from upper left at 45 degrees, shadow falling to the lower right, standing upright on visible flat ground plane, feet planted on floor, arms close to body within shoulder width, dark moody background, narrow compact pose. Wes Anderson style photograph, perfectly symmetrical composition, a single person standing dead center in frame, their head is replaced by an object related to their discipline, human body with an object for a head, the person is comically out of place in a pastel-colored environment, discipline accent color appears as a Wes Anderson pastel tone throughout the room and clothing, obsessive symmetry, geometric framing, the person just stands there like they belong even though they absolutely do not, warm soft natural lighting, vintage film stock look, slightly desaturated, whimsical deadpan absurdist humor, meticulously art directed set design, every detail intentional, Grand Budapest Hotel aesthetic, photorealistic. Entirely indigo purple monochromatic image, monochrome indigo purple, single color indigo purple, everything is deep purple indigo, indigo purple walls, indigo purple floor, indigo purple ceiling, indigo purple doors, indigo purple panels, indigo purple fixtures, deep purple indigo lighting casting purple indigo shadows, heavy purple indigo color grading, the entire scene drenched in deep purple indigo light, everything tinted purple indigo, a tall broad man with a large purple indigo drafting compass with both legs spread open where his head should be, compass for a head as the dominant feature, wearing a purple indigo three-piece suit with purple indigo pocket square, standing perfectly still dead center, compass head held upright as the focal point, inside an elevator interior completely purple indigo with purple indigo art deco paneling on each side, purple indigo floor indicator dial above the doors, purple indigo carpet, purple indigo handrails, purple indigo ceiling fixture, uniform purple indigo color throughout, deep violet blue.
