    A heavy industrial ball-peen hammer resting on a steel anvil. The hammer head is forged steel with visible machining marks and a slight blue temper color along the striking face. The wooden handle is worn smooth from use, with a leather grip wrap near the base. Scattered around the anvil base: a few hex bolts, metal shavings, and a small spirit level. Everything sits on a scarred workbench surface with burn marks and tool impressions.
