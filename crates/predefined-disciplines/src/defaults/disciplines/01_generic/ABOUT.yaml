philosophy: |
  Disciplines are HOW you work, not WHAT you build with.
  Focus on methodology and practices, not tech-specific tools.

visual_identity:
  style: "Industrial mechanical - faceless representations"
  theme: "Tangible objects: servers, circuit boards, terminals, cables, screens"
  tone: "Universal, functional, impersonal"
  references: "Technical diagrams, isometric hardware illustrations, blueprint aesthetics"

when_to_use:
  - "Existing codebases in any language"
  - "Projects with custom or unusual tech stacks"
  - "Learning Ralph without framework assumptions"

discipline_count: 8

characteristics:
  - "No tech stack assumptions"
  - "Universal development practices"
  - "Focus on work methodology over tooling"

image_prompt:
  positive: |
    A single industrial object or mechanical apparatus centered in frame against a dark gradient background (deep slate gray fading to black). The subject is a tangible piece of hardware or engineering equipment: circuit boards, server racks, oscilloscopes, mechanical tools, cables, terminals, CRT monitors. Rendered with technical precision like a product photograph from an industrial catalog. Lit with cold fluorescent overhead lighting creating sharp shadows and metallic reflections. No human figures — only objects and machines. The aesthetic is blueprint meets catalog photography: clinical, precise, functional. Muted color palette with steel grays, copper traces, and one dominant accent color. Film grain texture. The mood is methodical, impersonal, and quietly powerful — like opening a well-organized toolbox.
