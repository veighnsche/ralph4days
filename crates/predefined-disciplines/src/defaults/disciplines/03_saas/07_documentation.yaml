    Indigenous Australian male, late 50s, with long gray dreadlocks past shoulders, tall dignified build, full gray beard, wearing an absurdly elegant white ceremonial longcoat with luminous ivory thread detailing along every edge and polished silver clasps down the front, ivory-tinted reading glasses perched on his nose, writing deliberately with a luminous ivory stylus into an enormous ornate glowing white tome held open in his other hand, pages of soft white light drifting upward from its surface, dramatic warm white rim lighting, soft ivory ambient glow, inside a dark impossibly vast archive cathedral bathed in white light with infinite towering shelves packed with glowing ivory document spines and spiraling white knowledge streams cascading from the vaulted ceiling behind him.

  negative: |
    blank empty pages, closed book, empty shelves, no writing instrument, illiterate, confused by the text, young, lost in thought
