    Entirely crimson red monochromatic image, red color wash over everything, red tinted lighting, Japanese non-binary person, early 30s, with sharp asymmetric black bob with a single crimson streak, slim build, wearing a high-collar crimson red jacket with glowing red symbols etched into the stiff collar and red-lit buttons down the front, red-tinted monocle over one eye, holding up a glowing crimson keycard badge between two fingers while the other arm blocks the path forward palm-out, facing the viewer head up eyes forward, red background, inside a red-tinted access control chamber with massive red-lit security gates on both sides and columns of scrolling red authentication tokens projected on the red walls.

  negative: |
    open unlocked gates, welcoming everyone in, stepping aside, no keycard, no badge, permissive, passive doorman, apologetic expression
