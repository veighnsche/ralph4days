    Vertical 9:16 portrait photograph. Shot through subtle tilt-shift lens giving miniature-world softness to edges. Shallow depth of field with single plane of sharp focus, everything else gently falling off. Consistent grain structure resembling medium-format film stock. The mood is quiet, contemplative, and slightly romanticized — like a beautifully lit diorama viewed through glass. Color palette is muted and desaturated with one dominant accent color. The image should feel like a still from a Wes Anderson film crossed with a product catalog — precise, intentional, and deeply tactile.
